# The End

Congratulations! 🏆

You've reached the end of the React FUNdamentals workshop, learning JSX, `useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks, and so much more!

Hopefully, you'll get to apply this learning right away at your job or in a side project. But if not, I suggest you **come back to this workshop in a week or two** and review the content. Your brain likes to garbage collect unused knowledge and we want this to stick around! The content is all open-source.

## ❤️ Workshop Feedback

Feedback is a gift. 🎁 Now that you're done with the workshop, I would greatly appreciate your overall feedback on the workshop to help make it even better for the next learners. **[Share your workshop feedback](https://bit.ly/react-fun-ws-feedback)**.
