# Step 0 - Begin React Workshop

The goal of this step is to ensure you have everything set up with a running (but blank) app. We will be working in a step-by-step fashion to build a [Giphy search app](https://react-workshop.benmvp.com/).

## 📝 Tasks

Complete the [setup instructions](../../README.md#setup)! It's your **last chance**! 🏃🏾‍♂️

If you ran the setup **before today**, pull any changes to the repo and re-run the setup to ensure that you have the most up-to-date code examples:

```sh
git pull --rebase=false
npm run setup
```

This should run pretty quickly.

Finally, run the app if you haven't already!

```sh
npm start
```

Let's get started! 🎉

## 👉🏾 Next Step
